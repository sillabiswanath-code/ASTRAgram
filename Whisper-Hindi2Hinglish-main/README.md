## **About**

Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish is a variant of OpenAI's Whisper, designed for precise, speech recognition of audios with Indian accents and heavy background noise in Hinglish (Hindi written in Latin scripture) language. It is trained on Hindi and Hinglish data and is optimized for use cases where accuracy is paramount and background noise is abundant (such as those found in typical Indian background sounds). To improve transcription on Hindi language, we finetuned **Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish** using a custom-built proprietary dataset.

## **Problem Statement**:

- Existing ASR systems demonstrate significant limitations in accurately transcribing Indian speech, particularly Hindi and Hinglish conversations, leading to poor performance in real-world applications
    - Models perform inadequately with natural Indian accents and conversational patterns
    - Current systems struggle with background noise common in real-world Indian audio recordings
    - Available Hindi datasets are primarily recorded in controlled environments with scripted speech, making them unsuitable for practical applications

- Traditional Hindi transcription systems generating Devanagari scripture face critical challenges:
    - Minor transcription errors can result in completely different meanings of words and sentences
    - Integration with modern LLMs becomes complicated due to script incompatibility
    - Misalignment with user preferences, as most Indian internet users communicate in Hinglish rather than pure Hindi


- There is a significant gap in the Speech market for an ASR system that can:
    - Process and accurately transcribe Indian accents and natural conversational patterns
    - Maintain consistent performance even with substantial background noise
    - Output transcriptions in Hinglish to align with real-world usage patterns
    - Integrate smoothly with existing NLP pipelines and LLMs
    - Minimize hallucinations and false transcriptions in noisy environments


- The lack of such a system creates substantial barriers in:
    - Developing effective voice-based applications for the Indian market
    - Building reliable voice-based interfaces for various applications

## **Motivation**:

- Current state-of-the-art ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models exhibit a significant bias towards Western languages due to the abundant availability of high-quality training data for these languages.
- While Hindi language data exists, it suffers from several quality issues:
    - Most recordings are made in controlled environments with minimal background noise
    - Data is primarily non-conversational
    - Recordings typically feature speakers talking directly into microphones, and verbatim reading a script making the nature of the audio unnatural
    - These limitations make it difficult to train models that can handle real-world Indian accents with abundant background noise
- The crowdsourced nature of available Hindi datasets results in lower accuracy than English.
- There is a strong case for developing models that can transcribe audio into Hinglish (Hindi written in Latin script) because:
    - It reduces the likelihood of grammatical errors in transcriptions. As in the case of Hindi, even a small mistake can lead to a completely different sentence meaning. Example: बाल (baal) - "hair" vs बल (bal) - "strength", दिन (din) - "day" vs दीन (deen) - "poor/humble" etc.
    - It enables better comprehension by Large Language Models (LLMs)
    - It aligns with actual usage patterns, as most Indian internet users communicate in Hinglish rather than Hindi in Devanagari script

The above reasons were some of the main motivations behind training the Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish model.

## Key Features:
1. Hinglish as a language: Added ability to transcribe audio into spoken Hinglish language reducing chances of grammatical errors
2. Whisper Architecture: Based on the whisper architecture making it easy to use with the transformers package
3. Better Noise handling: The model is resistant to noise and thus does not return transcriptions for audio with just noise
4. Hallucination Mitigation: Minimizes transcription hallucinations to enhance accuracy.

## Relased Models:

We have open sourced two models [Oriserve/Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish-Prime](https://huggingface.co/Oriserve/Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish-Prime) and [Oriserve/Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish-Swift](https://huggingface.co/Oriserve/Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish-Swift). Under the `Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish` family of models.

## Usage

### Server
To start the server, run the following command:
```bash
python websocket_server.py
```
- The server will start listening on port 8000 by default. You can change the port by passing the `--port` argument.
- You can also change the model by passing the `--model-id` argument. The default model is `Oriserve/Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish-Swift` you can also use `Oriserve/Whisper-Hindi2Hinglish-Prime` for a better performance.
- To change the device on which the model is running, you can pass the `--device` argument. The default device is `cuda`.
- To change the data type on which the model is running, you can pass the `--dtype` argument. The default data type is `float16`.

### Client

#### File
To stream audio from a file, run the following command:
```bash
python client_file.py --uri <uri> --wav-path <wav-path> --chunk-duration <chunk-duration>
```

#### Microphone
To stream audio from your microphone, run the following command:
```bash
python client_mic.py --uri <uri> --device-index <device-index> --chunk-duration <chunk-duration>
```

- `uri`: The URI at which the server is running.
- `device-index`: The index of the microphone device to use (default: 0).
- `wav-path`: The path to the audio file.
- `chunk-duration`: The duration of each chunk in milliseconds (default: 10) to send to the server.

***Note***:
- As WebRTC VAD is used for speech detection, the chunk-duration should be either 10, 20, or 30 milliseconds.
- WebRTC VAD also only accepts 16-bit mono PCM audio, sampled at 8000, 16000, 32000 or 48000 Hz, so to enable VAD ensure that the audio file is in correct format.
- Currently, the server only supports linear16 encoding, mono audios.
- To choose the correct device-index when using the client_mic.py script, you can run the following code to check for different recording devices on your system:
    ```python
    import pyaudio

    p = pyaudio.PyAudio()

    device_count = p.get_device_count()

    for i in range(device_count):
        device_info = p.get_device_info_by_index(i)
        print(f"Device {i}: {device_info['name']}")
        print(f"  - Index: {device_info['index']}")
        print(f"  - Channels: {device_info['maxInputChannels']}")
        print(f"  - Default Sample Rate: {device_info['defaultSampleRate']}")
        print(f"  - Input Supported: {'Yes' if device_info['maxInputChannels'] > 0 else 'No'}")
        print(f"  - Output Supported: {'Yes' if device_info['maxOutputChannels'] > 0 else 'No'}")
        print("-" * 40)

    p.terminate()
    ```
    From the output you need to choose the device-index that supports input and has channels >= 1.

## Training:

### Data:

- **Duration**: A total of ~550 Hrs of noisy Indian-accented Hindi data was used to finetune the model.
- **Collection**: Due to a lack of ASR-ready hinglish datasets available, a specially curated proprietary dataset was used.
- **Labelling**: This data was then labeled using a SOTA model and the transcriptions were improved by human intervention.
- **Quality**: Emphasis was placed on collecting noisy data for the task as the intended use case of the model is in Indian environments where background noise is abundant.
- **Processing**: It was ensured that the audios are all chunked into chunks of length <30s, and there are at max 2 speakers in a clip. No further processing steps were done to not change the quality of the source data. As the audios in the proprietary dataset were manually collected, the quality of the data was not a concern.

### Finetuning:
- **Custom Dynamic Layer Freezing**:
    - Using `pytorch` hooks, we ran inference on a subset of the training data to collect data about layer activations.
    - We then analyzed the layer activation data and identified a subset of layers that were most active during inference, as the ones being most responsible for generating the transcriptions.
    - These layers were then kept unfrozen during the training process while all the other layers were kept frozen.
    - This enabled faster convergence and efficient finetuning.
- **Deepspeed Integration**: Deepspeed was also utilized to speed up, and optimize the training process.
- **Novel Trainer Architecture**:
    - To finetune the model we developed a custom trainer that was specifically designed to train the model.
    - The trainer was designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new functionalities, such as custom callbacks, custom optimizers, and custom dataloaders.
    - There were several custom callbacks that were added to the trainer to enable higher observability during the training process.
    - At every validation epoch, the model was evaluated on unseen data, that was not used during training. This allowed us to monitor the model's performance on unseen data as most of the time the model would have to perform on unseen data.
